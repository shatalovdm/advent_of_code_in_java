# Advent of code challenges

Here you can find my solutions to [Advent of code](http://adventofcode.com/2016), a sequence of coding challenges that unlock day-by-day as the holidays approach. I started a bit late and try to catch up as time permits.

All solutions are written in Java.

The creators of Advent of code provide the puzzle input for each challenge. To test the code against this input just run a program. 

So far I have comleted these challenges:

- Day 1: No Time for a Taxicab
- Day 2: Bathroom Security
